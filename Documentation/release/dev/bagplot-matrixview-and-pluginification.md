# BagPlotMatrixView and MultiDimensional BagPlot

A new parameter to the "Extract Bag Plot" filter has been added which allows to generate multi dimensional outputs.
A BagPlotMatrixView has been added to specifically visualize this data correctly in a PlotMatrixView.

# BagPlot Pluginification

All Bag Plot related features of ParaView were moved into a specific plugin called "BagPlotViewsAndFilters".
